The conflict was fought between 1701 and 1714, a struggle for control of the Spanish empire between the French Bourbons and the Austrian Habsburgs. Charles II of Spain, the last of the Spanish Habsburgs, died without an heir and supposedly named Philip of Anjou as his successor who was the grandson of Louis XIV. The war ended with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Philip became king of Spain and founded the Bourbon dynasty.</p><p>The map, by Dutch engraver and print publisher, Justus Danckerts is a detailed and colorful depiction of power and empire with a mighty navy and military about to become involved in yet another war.

I chose this map because it is one of my favorites and the history of this country which was once a mighty empire is portrayed in this map.

This map created by Richard Chiswell was British-made during the Age of Exploration and displays the tensions of European nations during the time period. The frame is very ornate, referencing Aristotelian elements, as well as depicting the eclipses of the sun and moon showing the known sphericity of Earth. It also includes a geocentric model, constellations, an armillary sphere, and four portraits of famous explorers: Sir Frances Drake, Ferdinand Magellan, Oliver Van Noort, and Thomas Cavendish. Throughout the double-hemisphere map, there are incredibly biased inset descriptions. Chiswell’s narratives provide a skewed perspective on the adventures of the explorers; this gives the viewers inflated information that depicts certain aspects of English exploration as more important than they were while short-handing the accomplishments of others.

A few years ago, while up in the vaults, I pulled out this small mid-19th century portfolio from the Smith Collection, and noticed it hadn't been digitized yet. Curious after reading the French title, I untied the string to see what was inside. I was immediately entranced by the colorful astronomical drawings and celestial models contained within, and noticed that the backings of many of the individual sheets had a layer of yellow tissue paper. A few years prior, an Art student noticed that one of our celestial models from the 19th century started glowing when illuminated from behind. This portfolio is similar--if you backlight the pages, or hold them up to natural light, the stars and planets begin to glow. 19th century educators were so clever in finding ways to continually engage and delight their students, and to really make the study of astronomy come alive in new and exciting ways, even before the widespread use of electricity in classrooms.",,Solar System,,,Smith Collection,2240,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,fre,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/,iiif,https://oshermaps.org/map/2240.0001,https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-166889/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=?manifest=https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-166889/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=,/objects/small/2240_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/2240_th.jpg,,

This is the first of two volumes of the Mercator-Hondius-Jansson atlas of the world, considered to be  one of the most influential atlases produced after Abraham Ortelius' death in 1598. Two notable engravings in this volume are the portrait of  Jodocus Hondius and Gerard Mercator produced  by Coletta Hondius (née Kaerius) to commemorate her husband, and the beautifully ornate double hemisphere map, <em>Nova totius terrarum orbis geographica ac hydrographica tabula</em>.</p><p>You might be asking, ""Why is this atlas closed?"" Scanning the shelves in our archives you will find unique and breathtaking examples of historic bindings that catch your eye: the flash of gold gilt, the luminous glow of vellum, and glimpses of covers with decorative marbling or textured paste-paper designs. I have become increasingly interested in the materiality of our collections, and this atlas was chosen to highlight the features of  the binding. Bound in a supple cow-skin leather with raised bands along the spine, the most striking features are the front and rear board; each is highly decorated with an all-over, gold-tooled fleur-de-lis motif framed by an ornate border with fillet divisions. All of these features are characteristic of a 17th century French-style of finishing; the process of adding decoration to a binding. Furthermore, the Louis XIV armorial centerpiece marks this binding as a product of the royal court, though there is no bookplate or inscription to indicate additional provenance within the volume.</p>",Atlas,,,,Smith Collection,14021,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,fre,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/,iiif,https://oshermaps.org/map/14021.0001,https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-166450/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=?manifest=https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-166450/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=,/objects/small/14021_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/14021_th.jpg,,

27,,Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Tabula,Frederik de Wit,1655,Jess Hovey,"<p>Some may not think of maps as having artistic value, though within our collections one can find several examples of maps that challenge the perception of maps as a purely functional resource. To this point, the <em>Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Tabula</em> is commendable in its artistry, and I selected this map purely for aesthetic purposes. What drama! The rich, saturated colors used on the whole of the image have retained their vibrancy now over 300 years beyond their original application, and robust figural depictions of the Roman elements, night, and day are letting it all hang out in the marginalia.</p><p>The <em>Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Tabula</em> is Frederik de Wit's updated  edition of Arnold Colom's map of the world. We have an alternate version of this map in our collections that is bound in the nautical Zee-Atlas by Hendrick Doncker (1688), where the revealing figures have been editorially censored with red tunics painted over their bodies. Was the decision to clothe the statuesque figures a request made by a client who commissioned the atlas, or did someone in the historical provenance of the atlas make their own colorful amendments? An answer to this question would be welcome if one can be found, but it is also fun to speculate about the differences between the two printings.</p>",World map,World,,,Osher Collection,44726,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,lat,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/,iiif,https://oshermaps.org/map/44726.0001,https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-114785/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=?manifest=https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-114785/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=,/objects/small/44726_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/44726_th.jpg,,

29,,Gettysburg Battle-Field,John Bachelder,1863,Ashley Towle,"I love this map for so many reasons. On a personal note, whenever I look at this map, I'm transported back to my days as an undergraduate student at Gettysburg College when I would spend hours getting lost exploring the battlefield. Picking out familiar places like Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, and Barlow's Knoll, gives me a tinge of nostalgia and feels a bit like a homecoming. I also love this map because my dad also has a copy of it hanging in his office. It reminds me of our mutual love for Civil War history and of the many father-daughter trips we took to Gettysburg and other Civil War battlefields. Getting to teach my students about the Civil War with this map always feels like a full circle moment. I love watching my students' reactions when they realize the level of detail in this map. Students from Maine always enjoy pouring over the map and looking for the location of the storied Twentieth Maine where Joshua Chamberlain famously ordered ""Fix Bayonets!"" and repulsed a Confederate attack intent on rolling up the left flank of the Union army on July 2. Beyond using this map to explore Civil War battle tactics and get an overview of the course of the battle, teaching with this map always leads to rich discussions about the importance of Gettysburg to Civil War history and the place of the battle in American memory. Finally, I appreciate that the map includes Gettysburg National Cemetery at the bottom. It was on November 19, 1863 that Abraham Lincoln came to Gettysburg to dedicate the cemetery and delivered his immortal Gettysburg Address. As a scholar of American deathways, this detail provides a convenient teachable moment for me to talk about the way that the Civil War transformed America's relationship to death and how the demand to provide a proper burial for the Union war-dead led to the establishment of national cemeteries.",Bird's eye view map,"Gettysburg, Pennsylvania",,,Osher Map Library Collection,52602,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/,iiif,https://oshermaps.org/map/52602.0001,https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-103449/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=?manifest=https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-103449/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=,/objects/small/52602_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/52602_th.jpg,,
30,,"Plan of Robert D. Gilson's Mill in Littleton, Mass.",Henry David Thoreau,1857,Adam Tuchinsky,"<p>""I should not talk so much about myself if there was anybody else whom I knew as well.” - Henry David Thoreau</p><p>Henry David Thoreau wrote avidly about the arrival of the railroad in Concord, Massachusetts. ‘We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us,’ he remarked. For Thoreau, who was also a skilled surveyor, the railroad was a metaphor for the vast changes wrought by the emergence of the new market and industrial economy. It transformed the country's sense of space, time, and the self. Certainly it transformed the world of maps. For me, reading the Transcendentalists was my own final stop in my journey from adolescent self-involvement to a more mature scholarly self-involvement. Reading Emerson, Thoreau, and Fuller, in a dark library lit a different kind of fire, both personal and professional. The first time I visited Maine was to climb Mt. Katahdin, a paperback copy of Thoreau's essays in tow, needlessly adding to the weight of my backpack, and unopened from sheer exhaustion. But reading and re-reading Thoreau determined how I would experience ‘wilderness,’ which is how I experienced a land that had already been crisscrossed for thousands of years, and had been relentlessly mapped for centuries, for middle-class adventure-leisure, and for Maine's natural resource economy. I did read Thoreau, but only on the train–the sad same railroad–and did so then without giving it the slightest bit of thought.</p>",Survey map,"LIttleton, Massachusetts",,,Osher Map Library Collection,52638,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/,iiif,https://oshermaps.org/map/52638.0001,https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-103456/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=?manifest=https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-103456/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=,/objects/small/52638_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/52638_th.jpg,,

32,,View of Old Orchard Beach,J.S. Locke,1879,Roberta Ransley-Matteau,"Locke’s view of Old Orchard Beach in 1879 conjures up images of the popular summer beach resort town with its elegant hotels and boarding houses along the beach. The town has a colorful history beginning in the 17th century with early explorations by Martin Pring and very likely John Smith. It grew into a tourist attraction and by the late 19th century people from Quebec, Montreal, New York and other cities came to relax and take in the sea air. The balloon view with its beachfront is now the location of Palace Playland Amusement Park. The once elegant hotels and boarding houses are no longer there. The Orchard House pictured third from left is now a Walgreens. The only building that has remained since 1898 is St. Margaret’s Catholic Church. Throughout its time as a resort destination, Old Orchard was known for its entertainment by leading musicians at the popular Casino Ballroom on the Pier. The likes of Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway played there. Amusement rides such as Noah’s Ark and the Jack and Jill slide were right along the main street replaced later by the Grand Victorian, expensive condominiums facing the pier and Palace Playland. I have lived in Old Orchard Beach for about 23 years. It has changed maybe for the better. It is more family friendly,  losing its past reputation as a wild town. It is somewhat quiet after Labor Day when the tourists leave and the locals can reclaim it. However like most towns and cities it has seen a lot of development and more people moving up here. I do like the town and its rather interesting past. I found photographs and postcards of its resort past and although there are no longer elegant ladies with parasols on the beach strolling with their husbands in bowler hats, it has evolved into people in bathing suits, shorts, carrying umbrellas and coolers along with excited children are almost like those families who came before them who enjoyed the atmosphere as those back in 1879.",Panorama map,"Old Orchard Beach, Maine",,,Osher Map Library Collection,53668,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/,iiif,https://oshermaps.org/map/53668.0001,https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-106293/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=?manifest=https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-106293/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=,/objects/small/53668_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/53668_th.jpg,,

38,,The Conquest of a Continent: A Pictorial Representation of the Westward Progress of the Pioneer,August Kaiser; Agnes Larson,1933,Adam Schmitt,"This map is intriguing to me for several reasons that directly connect to academic interests of mine. As a social studies educator, I'm interested in how specific time periods are taught, especially American expansionism. As an artifact, this map leans into several dominant tropes of the time period such as the erasure of Indigenous peoples (and the positioning of Indigenous peoples only in relation to white settlers) and the embodiment of Frederick Jackson Turner's Frontier Thesis. However, while westward expansion is often stripped of its imperial elements (Manifest Destiny being the fulfillment of a preordained fate), the map's authors recognize the imperial aspect of westward expansion as they also use Manifest Destiny to describe America's imperial ambitions beyond North America. Secondly, I am fascinated by how we conceptualize and represent time and this map has multiple chronological layers to it. If you look at the southwest, you can see contemporary state lines drawn over the various borders of land cessions (or land grabs) that led to those states. In addition, there are references to Arizona and New Mexico as the newest states. Several elements of American history are being collapsed throughout this map, asking readers to contend with the idea that the past is never quite past and is quite active in how we conceptualize the present and future. This map is a fantastic teaching resource and I love it for what it reveals about when it was made, but what it also makes us consider, recognize,  and implicate ourselves in how we make sense of the present, often in very similar ways, as well.",Pictoral map,United States of America,,,Osher Map Library Collection,54173,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,In Copyright,https://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,iiif,https://oshermaps.org/map/54173.0001,https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-108279/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=?manifest=https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-108279/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=,/objects/small/54173_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/54173_th.jpg,,

41,,Keep Cool! There will be nothing to worry about after we get votes for women: Election Day November 2,Mass Women Suffrage Association,1915,Brie Robichaud,"This fan is a miniature version of the Iconic “Votes for Women” Suffragette Signs. The text “Keep Cool, there will be nothing to worry about once we get Votes for Women” reminds me of the “Keep Calm and Carry On” slogan which was created as a motivational poster in the UK right before the start of World War 2. This sentiment has been adapted for lots of political and reform campaigns over the years, but I feel like the ladies of the Massachusetts Women's Suffrage Association thought of it first. This fan features a US Map showcasing how the West Coast had already won the right to vote for their women, and argues: ""If men of the West trust their women with the ballot, why can't women of Massachusetts be trusted?” Ultimately Massachusetts men voted against women's suffrage, and these women had to fight for another 5 years before (some) Massachusetts women were granted the right to vote and another 45 years before the 1965 Voting Rights Act protected voting rights for African Americans in the United States. So many women who fought for the right to vote never got the opportunity to, so I never take this right for granted, and will continue the fight against voter suppression like the generations of women before me.",Protest sign,,,,Osher Map Library Collection,54594,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/,iiif,https://oshermaps.org/map/54594.0001,https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-95452/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=?manifest=https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-95452/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=,/objects/small/54594_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/54594_th.jpg,,

You might recall that the 2020 summer Olympics in Tokyo were postponed until the summer of 2021 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. I distinctly remember looking through our collections to see if we had any maps of the Olympics, and we didn't, so I purchased this pictorial map made for the 1960 Olympics to address that absence. One of the things I find so interesting about this map is the way in which it shows how far we have come in gender equity in sports. In 1960, you can only see three women's events illustrated: figure skating, swimming and diving, and gymnastics. 64 years later, the 2024 were the first Olympics in history to achieve gender parity, with more than 50% of medal events open to women, and 28/32 sports with full gender equality.

44,,"Monhegan Island, Maine",Ruth Rhoads Lepper,1980,Jess Hovey,"<p>It might go without saying that ""place"" has significant meaning for visitors of the map library, as we all carry our lived experiences and personal histories with us. For me, the permanence of  ""place"" has been tenuous throughout my  lifetime and there are very few places that resonate with me—one being Monhegan Island. A dear friend of mine is a year-round resident, and visits to see her have connected me to the unique environment of the island and made me more familiar with its history. Located roughly 10 miles off the coast of Maine, the island is accessible primarily by boat. Much of the back half of the island is unpopulated and managed by a land trust, and they maintain hiking trails can take you the breadth of the island through densely moss-grown woods to the sheer rock cliffs that overlook the Atlantic Ocean (perfect for seal, whale, puffin, and mermaid spotting).</p><p>I selected this map of Monhegan for a couple of reasons: the artist Ruth Rhoads Lepper is an exemplary female cartographer and designer from Maine, and the whimsical style of the map–the decorative elements heighten the visual impact of the barebones nature of the village community. Oftentimes people arrive for their first visit on the island and ask, ""Is this it?""</p><p>Currently there is a lovely exhibition about Monhegan ""Art, Ecology, and the Resilience of a Maine Island: The Monhegan Wildlands,"" which is on display at the Bowdoin College Museum of Art.

The ‘temple’ has a spiritual dimension, which is essential today.

It also reminds us of the power of refugia, painful but brave spaces that call to mind for us the need to reorient from the power of particular groups and institutions to commit to nurturing life-giving shelters for all - indeed temples - that integrate life, matter and spirit.",,,,,Osher Map Library Collection,58968,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/,iiif,https://oshermaps.org/map/58968.0001,https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-199503/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=?manifest=https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-199503/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=,/objects/small/58968_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/58968_th.jpg,,

I love to introduce antique board games into our K-12 field trips whenever possible, and this one features some depictions of merchandise from the early 20th century, including my personal favorite: lead paint. I often tell field trip groups about how commonly lead paint was used in the past, which explains why we use modern game pieces when playing the antique board games, rather than the original game pieces.",Board game,,,,Osher Map Library Collection,59016,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/,record,https://oshermaps.org/map/59016.0001,,,,,
59,,Eclipse-O-Scope,Harvey & Lewis Company,1932,Libby Bischof,"Last April, like so many Mainers, my family and I got in the car and drove up to the Rangeley Lakes region of Maine, so we could be in the path of totality for the April 8, 2024 total eclipse. We got our approved eclipse glasses from a local library in order to protect our eyes while watching the historic event. These 1932 glasses were used by Mainers nearly 100 years prior–for the total eclipse visible in Maine on August 31, 1932. I will never forget where I was or who I was with when I witnessed the totality last year. It was among the most moving experiences of my life–one of my favorite things–hence the choice of these objects for the exhibit.

This handheld planisphere can be adjusted to display the visible stars for any time and date. Then, as now, planispheres helped their users learn how to recognize stars and constellations. One glance at this object tells me it’s from my favorite historical era, and I like to think about its users gazing up in wonder at the stars above, as I often do.

62,,"Plan of Falmouth Neck, now Portland, 1690",George N. Fernald,1885,Meghan Taylor,"Even though this map is very popular, it is one of my favorites for my elementary school students because of the simplistic and clear representation. As a class, we study how what we now call Portland has changed over time. This map allows for a clear comparison of how downtown Portland is today compared to the plan for it in 1690. Students are able to recognize some features that are still present, while noticing clear and dramatic changes, especially to the urban development and natural resources reduction. It is a map style that they can emulate and create their own map in the same style as an introduction to the further inquiry of how Portland has changed over time.",Landscape,"Portland, Maine",,,Osher Collection,7940-0012,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,Public domain,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/,iiif,https://oshermaps.org/map/7940.0012,https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-170727/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=?manifest=https://cdn1.historyit.com/iiif/5f34291499c4a6.60628694-170727/manifest?canvas_mode=assets&strip_tags=&child_metadata=,/objects/small/7940-0012_sm.jpg,/objects/thumbs/7940-0012_th.jpg,,

The first is reporting of the Soviets advancements along the eatern front as they pushed to ""liberate"" Ukraine as well as parts of Poland. By 1944, the Soviets are nearly completed in recapturing all lost territory that the USSR had occupied back in 1939. However it is not lost on me that this map in modern times can also help us understand the current conflict in Ukraine. Even featuring Kherson, an infamous battleground that thankfully remains in Ukraine's control. This map once showed the Soviets as allies, fighting to free those under fascist occupation.
